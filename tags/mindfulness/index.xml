      <description>I bought my first smartphone because I wanted to have my calendar accessible from my computer and phone. I kept forgetting my appointments and scheduling several things at the same time. Sounds reasonable, right?
Fast forward a couple of years and I found myself compulsively checking my phone. At first I was just trying to take advantage of idle moments while commuting or when waiting for something. By the end, I was checking my phone before even getting out of bed, while having dinner (and watching TV), while trying to work, even while having a good time with some friends.</description>
