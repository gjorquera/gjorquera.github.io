    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/the-flinch/">The Flinch</a>
    by Julien Smith
    · My rating: 2/5
  </strong>
  · A short book on how the flinch is holding you back. The flinch is that instinctive reaction you get whenever you want or need to do something. All it takes to overcome the flinch is a single moment of strength.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/how-to-stop-worrying-and-start-living/">How to Stop Worrying and Start Living</a>
    by Dale Carnegie
    · My rating: 3/5
  </strong>
  · Forget yesterday and don&#39;t think about tomorrow. Focus on today. Accept the worst and improve from there.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/the-daily-stoic/">The Daily Stoic</a>
    by Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman
    · My rating: 4/5
  </strong>
  · A lot of stoic quotes explained and brought to our daily lives. Even  though you should read this book on a daily basis, I couldn’t do it. I would either forget or read more than one quote per day.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/ego-is-the-enemy/">Ego is the Enemy</a>
    by Ryan Holiday
    · My rating: 5/5
  </strong>
  · Personal skill, effort, and consistency is only a small part of success. We&#39;re not that good; we need other people, we need luck. Don&#39;t let ego make you think otherwise, don&#39;t let it think that you can be successful on your own.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/the-subtle-art-of-not-giving-a-fck/">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</a>
    by Mark Manson
    · My rating: 5/5
  </strong>
  · You&#39;re already making decisions and choosing, all the time. You just need to change what to give a fuck about. It&#39;s going to suck. You&#39;re going to be nervous. You&#39;re going to freak out. You may get pissed off at people or piss off people. These are all necessary side effects of choosing where to place your fucks. Choose wisely.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/meditations/">Meditations</a>
    by Marcus Aurelius and Gregory Hays
    · My rating: 4/5
  </strong>
  · It&#39;s amazing how one of the most important person in the world, who lived more than 18 centuries ago, had to deal with the same problems that we deal on a daily basis. Contains timeless lessons about how to live a good life with the advice that Marcus Aurelius continuously told himself.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/the-obstacle-is-the-way/">The Obstacle is the Way</a>
    by Ryan Holiday
    · My rating: 5/5
  </strong>
  · Explains the three main stoic disciplines, perception, action, and will. Obstacles are not there to stop you, but to show you the correct path. The book is strictly better than my notes. Recommended to everyone.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/the-freedom-handbook/">The Freedom Handbook</a>
    by Jeff Hirz
    · My rating: 3/5
  </strong>
  · You can achieve personal freedom. It doesn&#39;t depend on external factors, only on you. Life, as it is today, is full of unnecessary burdens. Constantly clean up and periodically reflect upon your life to achieve freedom. Enjoying every bit of it without regrets.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/as-a-man-thinketh/">As a Man Thinketh</a>
    by James Allen
    · My rating: 3/5
  </strong>
  · Highly motivational, although without supporting studies or evidence, to convince you to improve your life. You&#39;re the sum of your thoughts; change your thoughts to change yourself.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/the-universe-doesnt-give-a-flying-fuck-about-you/">The Universe Doesn&#39;t Give a Flying Fuck About You</a>
    by Johnny Truant
    · My rating: 3/5
  </strong>
  · Everything you do, and don&#39;t do, is insignificant in the grand scheme of things. Eventually, nobody, and then nothing, will care. Stop worrying and start living.

    <a href="https://gaston.life/books/you-are-dying-and-your-world-is-a-lie/">You Are Dying, and Your World is a Lie</a>
    by Johnny Truant
    · My rating: 3/5
  </strong>
  · A short guide on the importance of doing important things. The time you spend worrying about things is time you&#39;re never getting back. Use your time to test your boundaries and increase your levels of discomfort. Greater joys comes after great discomforts.
