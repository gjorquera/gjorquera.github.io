      <description>I will not explain what Todoist or The Pomodoro Technique are nor its benefits. There are already lots of articles and blog posts doing that. I will only say that if you haven&amp;rsquo;t used them, you should at least try them. (I understand that they might not work for you, but it might give you a hint on what might.) If you are already using them, then awesome!
On this article I will focus on how to use them together since Todoist doesn&amp;rsquo;t support The Pomodoro Technique out of the box.</description>
