      <description>Do you remember a decade or two ago when you were bored? Do you remember how it felt? Not knowing what to do? Bouncing out ideas with your friends (or imaginary friends)?
Did you stop to think about how I asked &amp;ldquo;a decade or two ago&amp;rdquo; and not &amp;ldquo;a week or two ago&amp;rdquo; or even &amp;ldquo;a year or two ago&amp;rdquo;?
When was the last time you were bored?
It&amp;rsquo;s hard to feel bored with the constant notifications and noise around us due to technology.</description>

      <description>I bought my first smartphone because I wanted to have my calendar accessible from my computer and phone. I kept forgetting my appointments and scheduling several things at the same time. Sounds reasonable, right?
Fast forward a couple of years and I found myself compulsively checking my phone. At first I was just trying to take advantage of idle moments while commuting or when waiting for something. By the end, I was checking my phone before even getting out of bed, while having dinner (and watching TV), while trying to work, even while having a good time with some friends.</description>
