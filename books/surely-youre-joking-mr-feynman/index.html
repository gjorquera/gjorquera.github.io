    <p><em>These notes are not a summary of his stories but the lessons that I was able to
extract from his stories. His stories are much, much better.</em>
understand Feynman a little bit better then definitely read his book._</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest
person to fool. — Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is always resistance to innovation, to doing things differently. The
people that are before you are the <em>smart</em> ones, the ones that made it to where
they are and they are not always open to new ideas.</p>
<p>Understanding groups interests and strengths can help build synergies. This
requires both parties to understand how they can benefit from each other&rsquo;s
strengths.</p>
<p>The clueless isn&rsquo;t wrong just because he&rsquo;s clueless. They can still come up with
good ideas.</p>
<p>Cultural differences are important and must be considered.</p>
<p>Surround yourself with people solving harder and harder problems. Help others
solve their problems.</p>
<p>Try new things even if you don&rsquo;t understand them. Do them for the fun, to see
what&rsquo;s going to happen and where things lead to.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s your responsibility to feel comfortable where you are.</p>
<p>People often forget what they know if you take the knowledge out of the context
they are used to. Every once in a while try challenging someone on what they
already know.</p>
<p>People remember their own ideas, feelings, and conclusions about events. Not the
actual events.</p>
<p>Assumptions change.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s important to know both the good and the bad. To find out how the rest of
the world is. It&rsquo;s not helpful to always go to the best place possible.</p>
<p>Understand what social cues and habits mean. Don&rsquo;t expect for everyone to be
explicit, direct, nor honest.</p>
<p>Analogies are helpful to explain a subject given another subject but there&rsquo;s no
intrinsic value in the analogies themselves.</p>
<p>Theories are not reality. They are tools to understand reality.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t memorize useless stuff that can be looked up.</p>
<p>Always be tolerant of other ideas even if they are different from what you think
or propose.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t think in abstract terms by nature. We&rsquo;re concrete people. When
explaining things make up examples.</p>
<p>If you want to know secrets, ask the questions to make the other person feel
proud when giving the answer.</p>
<p>Models to simplify reality are helpful to understand complex things but keep in
mind that they are still <em>simplifications</em>.</p>
<p>Bravery is doing something even though you <em>know</em> it&rsquo;s terrible. Doing things
you&rsquo;re afraid of for the second time.</p>
<p>When discussing ideas, don&rsquo;t repeat what other people say. Remeber them,
consider them, and build better solutions on top of them.</p>
<p>Understanding the problem is essential. That&rsquo;s what allows people to invent ways
of doing things better and better.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about who you&rsquo;re talking to. Consider only the technical issues. If
the idea is bad, say it&rsquo;s bad. If it&rsquo;s good, say it&rsquo;s good.</p>
<p>Always address the root cause otherwise you&rsquo;re fooling yourself in thinking
you&rsquo;ve fixed the problem. Fix the class of problems, not each instance of the
problem.</p>
<p>Have something that you can come back to. Something that you&rsquo;re good at and
doesn&rsquo;t take you too much effort. Something that you can depend on when other
parts of your career gets difficult.</p>
<p>Teaching the basics, even if you know them very well, might be fun and
delighful. It doesn&rsquo;t do any harm to go over them every once in a while. It may
even be refreshing.</p>
<p>Learn from everyone who has something to teach you regardless of who they are.
You probably know nothing about most things.</p>
<p>Visualization and building up an attitude is important to address situations in
a deliberate way.</p>
<p>Making decisions to always do things a certain way frees you up from having to
make the decision over and over again. Decide and forget.</p>
<p>What you&rsquo;ve always wanted might not be good for you. Know yourself. Decline what
you&rsquo;ve always wanted if you know it will be bad for you.</p>
<p>Before arguing about something be sure to understand the other person&rsquo;s point of
view.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve made up your mind to test something out, then communicate the result
regardless of the outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So I have just one wish for you—the good luck to be somewhere where you are
free to maintain the kind of integrity I have described, and where you do not
feel forced by a need to maintain your position in the organization, or
financial support, or so on, to lose your integrity. May you have that
freedom. — Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
