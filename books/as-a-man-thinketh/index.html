    <p>Beware of your thoughts, as you are the sum of them. You are made or unmade by
your thoughts. Whatever you achieve or fail is a result of them. Act is the
result of thought.</p>
<p>You are in the exact place you need to be so you can learn and evolve.</p>
<p>Take care and cultivate your thoughts. Get rid of the wrong, useless and impure
thoughts.</p>
<p>Find the purpose to your thoughts. Purposeless thoughts are useless and void.</p>
<p>Practice right thinking to make your thoughts stronger, just as you can exercise
to make your muscles stronger. Be patient, as in everything, it takes time.</p>
<p>Conquer doubt and fear to be free from failure. Actions triggered by them never
accomplished anything. They use up all your energy, energy that should be used
on right thoughts.</p>
<p>Improve yourself to improve your circumstances. You don&rsquo;t attract what you want,
but what you are. Circumstances does not make you, they reveal to you.</p>
<p>If you sacrifice little, you&rsquo;ll achieve little. If you sacrifice much, you&rsquo;ll
achieve much. Decide how much you want to achieve and act accordingly.</p>
<p>Before associating luck with success, try to look for the sacrifices, daunting
efforts, right thoughts, and previous failures that made that success possible.</p>
<p>Watch and maintain your successes. If left alone, they&rsquo;ll quickly become
failures.</p>
<p>Your body is a reflection of your thoughts. Cultivate pure thoughts and you&rsquo;ll
reflect them in your body.</p>
<p>Protect your body by protecting your mind. Once your mind is pure, you&rsquo;ll no
longer desire impure food.</p>
<p>Cultivate the calmness of mind. Not numbness, but calmness. A calm man knows how
to adapt himself for others, and is reverenced by them. A calm man can control
the passion, grief, anxiety, and doubt that is so natural to humanity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Self-control is strength; Right Thought is mastery; Calmness is power. — James
Allen</p>
