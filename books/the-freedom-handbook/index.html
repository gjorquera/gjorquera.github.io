    <h2 id="your-freedom-depends-on-you">Your Freedom Depends on You</h2>
<p>Stop thinking on freedom as a restraint. There is nothing you have to break free
from.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nothing outside ourselves will ever make us free. — Jeff Hirz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stop thinking you&rsquo;re going to be happy once you achieve something, anything.</p>
<p>Remove everything that takes energy from you and doesn&rsquo;t contribute towards your
well being.</p>
<p>Decide to stop spending time cleaning things you don&rsquo;t find beautiful. Stop
maintaining things you don&rsquo;t use. Stop hanging out with people that makes you
feel less than awesome.</p>
<p>Let go everything robbing your time and energy, so you can focus on what truly
matters.</p>
<p>Do it now. You don&rsquo;t need anything to happen before you take action.</p>
<p>Beware of empty experiences.</p>
<p>Enjoy yourself, but don&rsquo;t let it dominate your life.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let anything dominate your life.</p>
<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<p>You, with your limited intellect, will never know the exact consequences of your
actions.</p>
<p>Realize that your truth is different from everybody else&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Learn to differentiate the frivolous from the important.</p>
<p>Accept the fact that everybody gets hurt, and everybody hurts others.</p>
<p>Avoid reacting to your judgement. Your opinions are not more important than
actions themselves.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t become emotionless, but don&rsquo;t become a slave to them.</p>
<p>Acknowledge your emotions.</p>
<p>Be aware of the emotions that external things causes. Watch out your reactions.
Decide how to best express your emotions.</p>
<p>Become interesting by becoming interested in new skills and knowledge.</p>
<h2 id="responsibility">Responsibility</h2>
<p>Accept that everything that happens to you is the culmination of your choices.</p>
<p>Things aren&rsquo;t inherently “good” or “bad”. These are labels we attach to them.</p>
<p>Enable forgiveness by detaching yourself from the next “bad” thing that happens
to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people is fit to rule
them. — Jeff Hirz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do everything the best you can, then let go of the results. The journey is more
important than the destination.</p>
<p>Think about the future. Just don&rsquo;t attach yourself emotionally to possible
outcomes.</p>
<p>Seek the truth. We are overloaded with information. Do the research, verify the
claims, and evaluate if it is good for you.</p>
<p>Moderate your excesses. Avoid letting new and beautiful things become mundane.</p>
<p>Let go of fear. It&rsquo;s obsolete. We aren&rsquo;t in the same danger as we were thousand
of years ago.</p>
<p>Remember that one day you&rsquo;ll die. Accept it as soon as you can.</p>
<h2 id="healthy-habits">Healthy Habits</h2>
<p>Improve your awareness by constantly asking yourself what are you doing right
now and why.</p>
<p>Reduce your distractions, to increase awareness.</p>
<p>Never stop getting rid of burdens, regardless of their form. Make room for
things that matters.</p>
<p>Find a few minutes every day to be quiet, still, and present.</p>
