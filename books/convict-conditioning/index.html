    <p><em>Note: These notes doesn&rsquo;t include the actual calisthenics program explained in
the book.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Calisthenics (&hellip;) it comes from the ancient Greek <em>kallos</em> meaning &ldquo;beauty&rdquo;,
and <em>sthénos</em>, which means &ldquo;strength&rdquo;. — Paul Wade</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Calisthenics is a strength training system.</p>
<p>These are the main benefits of doing calisthenics:</p>
<ul>
<li>It requires very little equipment because they are exercises using your own
bodyweight. It&rsquo;s also free.</li>
<li>It develops functional athletic abilities because you learn to work and move
your body.</li>
<li>It maximizes strength because it&rsquo;s designed to work the body as it evolved to
work, exercising muscles but also tendons, joints, and nervous system. It also
exercises multiple muscle groups at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Convict Conditioning is a calisthenics program based around six types of
movements—the &ldquo;Big Six&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pushups</li>
<li>Squats</li>
<li>Pullups</li>
<li>Leg raises</li>
<li>Bridges</li>
<li>Handstand pushups</li>
</ol>
<p>Each type of movement of the &ldquo;Big Six&rdquo; is divided in &ldquo;Ten Steps&rdquo; of increasing
difficulty.</p>
<p>Given a type of movement and a step, there&rsquo;s a progression chart to get from the
given step to the next.</p>
<p>The last step of each type of movement of the &ldquo;Big Six&rdquo; is called the &ldquo;Master
Step&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li>One-arm pushup</li>
<li>Full one-leg squat</li>
<li>Full one-arm pullup</li>
<li>Hanging straight leg raise</li>
<li>Stand-to-stand bridge</li>
<li>One-arm handstand pushup</li>
</ol>
<p>Start slow and start from the beginning.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t rush to go to the next step. It&rsquo;s more important to learn everything you
can from the given step (considering both equilibrium and coordination as well
as strength) before going to the next level.</p>
<p>Do each repetition in 5 seconds: 2 seconds &ldquo;going in&rdquo;, 1 second in the hardest
point, and 2 seconds &ldquo;going out&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Never bounce out of any movement. Avoid fast, plyometric, movements. Smooth
technique develops more strength.</p>
<p>Always leave some energy in your muscles so you can control your body. Don&rsquo;t
train to failure.</p>
<p>Adapt exercises between steps or progressions if you need to go slower. In
reality, there&rsquo;s an infinite number of steps. The program is a guide, not a
rule. Most exercises have variations.</p>
<p>Alternating exercises per day (versus doing the same routine every day) helps
the body not to get used to the routine.</p>
<p>Focus on the form, on the timing (2-1-2), and on the difficulty. It has to be
difficult. This program is designed to take very little time but it must be a
very intense workout.</p>
<p>Warm up by doing a couple of sets of the type of movement your exercising today
but at an easier level. Aim at 50% of your maximum in your warm up sets.</p>
<p>Rest enough between sets so that you can start the next set and give it your
all.</p>
<p>Progressions with a lot of repetitions are meant to increase coordination rather
than strength. Even though it&rsquo;s not focused on strength, they&rsquo;re still
important.</p>
<p>Cardio is important but there are a lot of different ways to get your cardio,
including bodyweight exercises with higher repetitions.</p>
<p>Active stretching is better than passive stretching.</p>
<p>Sleep. Start every workout fully rested and ready to give it your fullest.</p>
<h2 id="pushups">Pushups</h2>
<p>Avoid bizarre angles and hand positions. Use your palms flat on the floor to
avoid injuries.</p>
<p>Keep the torso, hips, and legs aligned.</p>
<p>Keep the legs together.</p>
<p>Straighten your arms at the top of the movement but don&rsquo;t hyperextend the
elbows.</p>
<h2 id="squats">Squats</h2>
<p>Real strength comes from the force transmitted from the ground up through the
legs and hips.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use barbells. They compress the vertebrae and makes you do awkward
movements.</p>
<p>Squat until your hamstrings are pressing on your calves and you cannot descend
any further.</p>
<p>Straighten your legs at the top of the movement but don&rsquo;t hyperextend the knees.</p>
<p>Bend forwards as little as possible, only enough to avoid falling backwards.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t lift your heels, stretch your calves instead.</p>
<h2 id="pullups">Pullups</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s the safest upper back exercise.</p>
<p>Pull until your chin is above the bar at the top of the movement and don&rsquo;t go
further.</p>
<p>Keep your arms almost straight at the bottom of the movement. Never relax into a
full arm stretch.</p>
<p>Push your shoulders away from your head, never relax your shoulders.</p>
<p>Use whatever hand grip works for you.</p>
<h2 id="leg-raises">Leg Raises</h2>
<p>Pull in your stomach during ab movements to train your transversus.</p>
<p>If you have tight hamstrings, stretch them before exercising.</p>
<h2 id="bridges">Bridges</h2>
<p>Curve your spine, don&rsquo;t allow it to be straight.</p>
<p>Raise your hips high off the floor.</p>
<p>Straighten your arms and legs.</p>
<p>The first three steps will help you ease old injuries, increase backwards
flexibility, and loosen the hip flexors. Take your time on these exercises.</p>
<h2 id="handstand-pushups">Handstand Pushups</h2>
<p>Position your elbows angled forward in a natural way avoiding unnatural elbows
at your sides.</p>
<p>Put your hands shoulder width apart.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t force your elbows apart, they will naturally angle inwards.</p>
<p>Keep your back gently curved. This is natural to keep equilibrium in the inverse
position.</p>
<p>Only your heels should be touching the wall, with enough pressure to retain
balance, not your whole weight.</p>
