    <p>If you feel like your days are too short, more time each day is not the
solution. Parkinson&rsquo;s Law seems to be a thing.</p>
<p>Fear, doubt and anxiety over the past arises when we look at all our unfinished
tasks.</p>
<p>Realise the fact that urgent tasks are taking time from important tasks.</p>
<p>This is a problem of priorities, not time. The problem is the choice you make.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not your responsibility to do something just because you can, however
urgent it is.</p>
<p>Resist the urge to follow an unexpected opportunity or demand. They will take
time to your important tasks.</p>
<p>When asked for a meeting, never accept it right away. Even if you have a clear
calendar. Think it over, look at your time budget, look at your priorities, and
decide if it&rsquo;s important. If it&rsquo;s an unexpected task, decide what other
scheduled task should be eliminated.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re like me, you don&rsquo;t have time to do many things, but you have a lot of
time to watch TV. Change your words, instead of saying “I don&rsquo;t have time for
this”, say “It&rsquo;s not my priority”. It&rsquo;ll make you think on what your priorities
actually are.</p>
<p>Decide what&rsquo;s important and then use your time towards it.</p>
<p>At night, write a list of everything you did today. Those are your current
priorities. Your priorities are what you do every day, not what you wish you
have done, or what you say you&rsquo;ll do tomorrow.</p>
<p>Having a clearer picture of how you spend time, make one change at a time
towards your new priorities. One change that doesn&rsquo;t involve too much effort.
Then decide what activity must be reduced or eliminated to make time for the new
change.</p>
<p>Only after finishing important tasks, you&rsquo;ll be able to look at uncompleted
tasks in peace.</p>
<p>Let yourself spend time in hobbies, recreation, exercise, or simply being alone.
These are important things, even though they might not be productive.</p>
<p>Not everything productive is important and not everything important is
productive.</p>
