    <p>Don&rsquo;t hide behind being “busy”. Don&rsquo;t fill your life with activities. Don&rsquo;t
spend time doing things regardless of their impact in your life.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think that just by going faster you&rsquo;ll achieve more. It&rsquo;s a fallacy. You
won&rsquo;t feel fulfilled even if you finish a thousand of unimportant tasks.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t just count the activities you do, also weigh the importance of them.</p>
<p>Stop doing things that doesn&rsquo;t matter thinking that you&rsquo;ll have time for
yourself later. The truth is that you don&rsquo;t know how much time you have left.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimalism is about eliminating the unnecessary so you can focus on what&rsquo;s
most important. — Mike Burns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your time, space, and energy is limited. Eliminate that which is less important
so you can enjoy and focus on that which is important.</p>
<p>Minimalism is about priorities. Your priorities. You decide what&rsquo;s important in
your life.</p>
<p>Do the work and think hard on what you want in life and on your priorities. Then
be willing to say “no” to the rest to keep your focus.</p>
<p>Prepare yourself to say “no” to those noble project that aren&rsquo;t right for you,
or that the time isn&rsquo;t right. To those things you just like.</p>
<p>Remember, you are saying “no” so you can say truly “yes” to those few things
that are important to you.</p>
<p>Some important questions you can make to yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the things that I couldn&rsquo;t live without?</li>
<li>Who are the people that I love most?</li>
<li>What causes or ideas excite me or bring emotion?</li>
<li>When my life is over, who will be present at my funeral?</li>
<li>What will I want them to say about me when I&rsquo;m gone?</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The process IS the destination. — Mike Burns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simplifying takes work, but it&rsquo;s good work, it&rsquo;s an investment. You spend time
and energy reducing clutter so you can enjoy more time and energy in what
matters.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that life is complicated, but you don&rsquo;t need to surrender to it.
Things can always get simpler.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let life happen to you. Learn from things as they get complex. Refuse to
let conflict stop you to keep going forward.</p>
<p>Always try to be part of the solution, instead of part of the problem.</p>
<p>Leave things better than you find them. Leave people better than you find them.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t expect someone else to clean up your mess. Do it yourself.</p>
<p>Stop letting information to clutter your minds. Stop letting urgencies and the
idea of being productive take up all our bandwidth. Leave space for creativity.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t use piles of objects as reminders of undone tasks. Put them where they
belong.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t keep piles of books as reminders or trophies. It will make you feel less
guilt and free up your mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most of those books will be outdated when it comes time for your children to
read them. — Mike Burns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try to slow down to a sustainable pace. Not so fast that you miss opportunities,
hinder creativity, or end up exhausted. But no so slow that you don&rsquo;t feel like
you&rsquo;re not moving forward.</p>
<p>Walk through life noticing people.</p>
<p>Remember that the end goal is not to be clutter-free. It&rsquo;s to enjoy the time
that minimalism gives you for important things.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get angry if someone threatens your decluttered space.</p>
<p>Be mindful of the new time and energy that you have because you&rsquo;re a minimalist.</p>
<p>People are more important than things. Enjoy spending time with them.</p>
<p>You can only make a significant difference in a handful of people. Figure out
who those are and build those relationships.</p>
