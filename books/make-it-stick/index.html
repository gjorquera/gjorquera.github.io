    <blockquote>
<p>Learning: we mean acquiring knowledge and skills and having them readily
available from memory so you can make sense of future problems and
opportunities. — Peter Brown</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Learning is a skill. Develop it, as it&rsquo;ll be your most valuable skill.</p>
<p>Learning is hard and it usually isn&rsquo;t enjoyable. It depends more on the kind of
effort spent while learning than on genetics. Be patient and determined.</p>
<p>In practice, there&rsquo;s no limit to what we can remember. Retrieving those memories
is a lot harder. The skill of learning focuses on techniques to improve
retrieval.</p>
<p>You build knowledge upon your existing knowledge. The more you learn, them more
you&rsquo;ll be able to learn.</p>
<h2 id="good-ways-to-learn">Good Ways to Learn</h2>
<p>Look for concrete and personal examples for abstract ideas.</p>
<p>Develop the habit of self-quizzing. After you read something important, close
your eyes and try to explain it with your own words.</p>
<p>Develop the habit of reflection. Close your eyes, visualise a previous
situation, and figure out what you can do different in the future.</p>
<p>Create mental models. While extracting the main ideas from texts, create models
and associate them with models you already know.</p>
<p>Space your repetitions. Space your practice sessions enough so that it&rsquo;s
difficult to remember. Avoid spacing them so that you need to learn again.</p>
<p>Interleave your practice. Include memories from different contexts in your
practice sessions. It helps you to build the ability to discriminate the context
and pick correct way to solve a problem.</p>
<p>Vary your practice. Include slight variations of a problem in your practice
sessions. It helps you to build the ability to adapt and to discern when your
knowledge isn&rsquo;t actually enough.</p>
<p>Practice like it&rsquo;s the real thing. Don&rsquo;t frustrate when real life doesn&rsquo;t look
like your practice sessions. Focus on practicing adaptation and flexibility,
always keeping an eye on real life situations.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fear failure. Some of the best lessons you&rsquo;ll learn will come from
failures. Try new things even if there&rsquo;s risk associated.</p>
<p>Solve it yourself first. Struggling with something new helps you understand the
lesson better when explained. Don&rsquo;t look for the answer or feedback right away.
Fail yourself first.</p>
<p>Make your goal to learn. Even if you fail, when learning is your goal, you&rsquo;ll
pick situations that&rsquo;ll make you grow. If your goal is performance, then you&rsquo;ll
pick things you know how to do well. You&rsquo;ll never improve that way.</p>
<p>Sleep is good. You consolidate and strengthen memories while sleeping. Consider
sleeping between practice sessions.</p>
<h2 id="bad-ways-to-learn">Bad Ways to Learn</h2>
<p>Reading multiple times a text. It makes you think you know something when you
only understand it. Understanding a text is not the same as knowing the ideas
behind it.</p>
<p>Massed practice. Uses short-term memory, which makes you believe you&rsquo;re learning
fast. What you don&rsquo;t know is that you&rsquo;ll also be forgetting it as fast as you
learned it.</p>
<p>Believing that you don&rsquo;t need to practice anymore. You need to practice your
knowledge from time to time. If you decide you know something and stop
practicing, you&rsquo;ll forget it.</p>
<h2 id="cultivate-good-judgement">Cultivate Good Judgement</h2>
<p>Develop the skill of good judgement. You&rsquo;ll make errors of judgement, without a
doubt. But develop the habit of being an observer to your own thoughts and
actions.</p>
<p>Decide if you should follow your instinct or not. Don&rsquo;t always follow it, and
don&rsquo;t always reject it. Develop the habit of evaluating your intuition.</p>
<p>Test your knowledge to have an accurate idea of what you know and what you don&rsquo;t
know.</p>
<p>Judge your own performance by asking for peer review. It&rsquo;ll help you develop the
ability to discern between competence and incompetence.</p>
