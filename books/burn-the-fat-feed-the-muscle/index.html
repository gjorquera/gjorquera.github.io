    <p>To improve your body (getting leaner and healthier) you need to work on
different areas. Achieving a very lean body is the result of a lifestyle change.</p>
<p>There areas you need to work on are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mental training</li>
<li>Nutrition</li>
<li>Weight training</li>
<li>Cardio training</li>
</ol>
<p>To obtain permanent results you need to adopt new, healthier habits that you can
maintain for the rest of your life. These habits include the way you think, the
way you eat, and the way you move.</p>
<p>Know yourself. Not everyone has the same body type. Not everyone responds the
same way to exercise and nutrition.</p>
<p>Know your predominant body type:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Endomorphs</em> are the large, fatter types that have difficulty losing body fat.</li>
<li><em>Mesomorphs</em> are the mostly muscular types that gain muscle with ease.</li>
<li><em>Ectomorphs</em> are the lean, skinny types with fast metabolisms and extremely
low body fat.</li>
</ul>
<p>Prioritize body composition over body weight. The best way to measure your body
composition is to measure your body fat percentage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can&rsquo;t achieve excellence if you&rsquo;re aiming for average. When two-thirds of
the population is overweight or obese, average isn&rsquo;t so good. — Tom Venuto</p>

<h2 id="mental-training">Mental Training</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to become better than someone else; become better than you used to
be. — Tom Venuto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things you control:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your overall lifestyle.</li>
<li>Your mental attitude.</li>
<li>Who you allow to influence you.</li>
<li>How much, what, and when you eat.</li>
<li>What type, frequency, duration, and intensity of the exercises you do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Set goals with these characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific. How many pounds of fat will you lose? By when?</li>
<li>Measurable. You need to know if you&rsquo;ve hit your goal.</li>
<li>Big. Average is no longer good enough.</li>
<li>Realistic deadlines. The speed at which you pursue your goals has to be
realistic.</li>
<li>Long-term and short-term. Keep working towards those long-term goals while
achieving your short-term goals.</li>
<li>Affirmations. Your mind will interpret them as things you must do.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read your goals at least twice a day and keep them always in your mind.
Visualize your goals every time you read them.</p>
<p>If you feel frustrated or discouraged, focus on your daily goals, not on the
huge amount of work ahead of you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t choose conflicting goals. It&rsquo;s too hard to gain muscle while losing body
fat. Focus all your energy in the most important one and then focus on the other
one.</p>
<p>When you accomplish one of your goals make sure you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celebrate or reward yourself.</li>
<li>Keep a list of your achieved goals.</li>
<li>Set new goals.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nutrition">Nutrition</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Discipline is doing what is hard and necessary rather than what is fun and
easy and doing it when it&rsquo;s necessary, whether you feel like doing it or not.
— Brian Tracy</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="about-calories">About Calories</h3>
<p>To lose weight, you must burn more calories than you consume each day. To gain
weight, you must consume more calories than you burn each day.</p>
<p>Calorie quality is as important as calorie quantity. It&rsquo;s not enough to be in a
calorie deficit or surplus. You also need certain macronutrients distribution
and nutritive foods.</p>
<p>Control and keep track of your calories all the time, even with your occasional
cheat meals.</p>
<p>Be serious about counting calories otherwise you cannot adjust week by week
effectively.</p>
<p>Learn to listen to your stomach. Notice when it&rsquo;s full. Never stuff yourself.</p>
<p>Your basal metabolic rate (Katch-McArdle Equation) is:</p>
<p>$$370 + (21.6 * \text{lean mass in kilograms})$$</p>
<p>Your total daily energy expenditure is your basal metabolic rate times your
activity level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sedentary: 1.2</li>
<li>Lightly active: 1.375</li>
<li>Moderately active: 1.55</li>
<li>Very active: 1.729</li>
<li>Extremely active: 1.9</li>
</ul>
<p>Choose a deficit between 15% and 30% below your total daily energy expenditure
for healthy, long-term fat loss. The leaner you are, the smaller the deficit.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t do extreme calorie deficits. Your body can&rsquo;t tell the difference between
dieting and starvation. On starvation, your body will easily store energy as
fat, decrease energy expenditure, decrease your metabolism, and increase
food-seeking behaviors.</p>
<h3 id="about-macronutrients">About Macronutrients</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>What you eat occasionally has little impact on your health or body
composition. What you eat every day is what matters the most. Take it
seriously. — Tom Venuto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You need a proper balance between protein, carbs, and fats. And, yes, you need
to eat all three macronutrients.</p>
<p>A good starting point is 50% carbs, 30% protein, and 20% fat. Try to hit your
target macronutrients daily within 5%.</p>
<p>Every meal should contain lean proteins with a starchy and a fibrous carb.</p>
<p>Eat four to six times a day and divide the calories you need between these
meals. It helps avoiding snacks because you&rsquo;ll be eating every few hours.</p>
<p>Plan your meals and budget your macronutrients as if it were a money budget.
Don&rsquo;t eat unplanned calories as you would avoid unplanned expenses.</p>
<p>Eat protein and carbs before and after your weight training workouts. Eat 0.4 to
0.5 grams of protein per kilogram of lean body mass both before and after your
workouts. Carbs should be at least the same as protein.</p>
<p>Drink a lot of water. Don&rsquo;t get dehydrated. When in doubt, have a glass of
water.</p>
<p>Drink water when you wake up. Drink 500 milliliters of water anywhere between 2
hours to 20 minutes before your workout. Drink 200 milliliters every 15 minutes
during workouts. Drink 500 milliliters after your workout.</p>
<h4 id="protein-the-muscle-builder">Protein: The Muscle Builder</h4>
<p>Foods that contain all essential and nonessential amino acids in the exact ratio
and amounts are called complete proteins. Highest quality proteins comes from
animal sources.</p>
<p>The key to maintaining muscle is eating enough protein and being conservative
with calorie deficits. Eat 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day.</p>
<p>Maximum 40 grams of protein per meal.</p>
<p>For muscle growth you need adequate proteins, surplus calories, and progressive
weight training. Eat 1.1 to 1.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight.</p>
<h4 id="carbs-the-daily-energy">Carbs: The Daily Energy</h4>
<p>Carbs are the energy you need for short, high intensity exercise, such as
sprinting or weight lifting.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t eat refined carbs. Don&rsquo;t eat refined sugars. White sugar has no vitamins,
no minerals, no amino acids, just pure calories.</p>
<p>Prefer fibrous carbs over starchy carbs.</p>
<p>For starchy carbs, prefer whole grains and unprocessed starches.</p>
<h4 id="fat-the-good-and-the-bad">Fat: The Good and The Bad</h4>
<p>You need fats to maintain normal anabolic hormone levels. Healthy fat slows
digestion, which helps control blood sugar and insulin.</p>
<p>Saturated fats comes primarily from animals. They lack essential required fatty
acids, so you must balance them with unsaturated fats.</p>
<p>Unsaturated fats comes primarily from plants.</p>
<p>Essential fatty acids Omega-3 (fish oil) is usually missed in diets. Eat between
1.5 and 2.0 grams of combined DHA/EPA if you&rsquo;re losing fat.</p>
<p>Avoid hydrogenated, partially hydrogenated, and trans-fatty acids.</p>
<p>The blacklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fried foods.</li>
<li>Cookies, crackers, biscuits.</li>
<li>Pies, pastries, frostings, doughnuts.</li>
<li>Corn chips, taco shells.</li>
<li>Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, refined vegetable oils.</li>
<li>Packaged backed goods.</li>
<li>Margarine.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weight-training">Weight Training</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t go to the gym to maintain; I go to the gym to improve. And if I want
to improve, then today I must aim to beat my previous workouts and do
something I&rsquo;ve never done before. — Tom Venuto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do progressive resistance training. Whenever possible, lift more weight, do more
reps, do the same workout in less time, or increase the workload.</p>
<p>Target 8-12 repetitions. If you hit 12 repetitions, increase the workload so you
go back to 8.</p>
<p>Rest between sets so you can do each set at your fullest.</p>
<p>Five sets of five reps is a very popular strength workout.</p>
<p>Do each movement under control and never bounce back.</p>
<p>Always warm up before each workout. Start with one or two light, nonfatiguing
sets of each exercise before doing your heavy work sets.</p>
<p>Never push through &ldquo;bad pains&rdquo; or injuries.</p>
<p>Static stretching is for increasing flexibility, not for warming up.</p>
<h2 id="cardio">Cardio</h2>
<p>Cario is any exercise that&rsquo;s rhythmic in nature, involves large muscle groups,
raises your heart rate and breathing, and that you can sustain for extended
periods of time.</p>
<p>It can be running, walking, cycling, swimming, rowing, skiing, etc.</p>
<p>Pick the cardio you enjoy and mix it up if you want.</p>
<p>Do 5-7 days of cardio a week for fat loss. Do 3-4 days of cardio a week for
maintenance.</p>
<p>Burn 400-600 calories per cardio workout.</p>
<p>High intensity interval training helps reduce the workout duration while keeping
burned calories high and boosts your metabolism for hours after the workout is
over.</p>
<p>The best time for a workout is when you feel most physically energetic, mentally
focused, and motivated.</p>
<p>Consistency is more important than schedule.</p>
<p>Vary intensity, volume, weight, and other variables to avoid letting your body
adapt to cardio.</p>
<h2 id="feedback-loop">Feedback Loop</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no such thing as failure—only feedback, only results. — Tom Venuto</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Weight yourself on the same scale, at the same time of day, and wearing the same
amount of clothes.</p>
<p>Measure your body fat every Monday and make adjustments for your current week
depending on your previous week&rsquo;s results.</p>
<p>The trend over time is more important than any one-week fluctuation.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t fix things that aren&rsquo;t broken. If what you&rsquo;re doing gets you to gain lean
muscle or burn fat then keep doing it. Adjust as results starts to change.</p>
