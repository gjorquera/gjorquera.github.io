    <h2 id="being-a-programmer">Being a Programmer</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t become a programmer only because someone tells you to. Become a programmer
because you want to solve problems, you want to write your own rules, and you
enjoy doing it.</p>
<p>The most important skill for a programmer is the ability to effectively
communicate ideas. This leads to code that communicates intention. The only work
that&rsquo;s reusable is the one that you understand what it communicates.</p>
<p>Always keep on studying and practicing on how to write. Create a blog. Write
open source code. Never stop getting your writing out there for others to
criticize it.</p>
<p>Use StackOverflow to improve your writing. If your answer doesn&rsquo;t end at the
top, figure out how to improve it. Maybe your answer was too verbose, maybe
there was something missing.</p>
<p>Use writing as a tool to figure out what you don&rsquo;t truly understand.</p>
<p>Always leave time in your coding for discussion, introspection, and to study.
That&rsquo;s how you stop doing always the same thing, improve your solutions, and
move forward.</p>
<p>Incessant and obsessive practice and desire for improvement is another form of
procrastination.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have to strike a mindful balance between practicing your craft and
thinking about how you practice your craft. — Jeff Atwood</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Never stop reading. Even if most of what you read is not new, try to find that
one thing that will help you improve.</p>
<p>If you have an idea that someone copied, be proud to have something worth
copying.</p>
<p>Take full responsibility for the failures produced by your software. It will
earn you respect and credibility.</p>
<p>Your job as a programmer is to solve the customer&rsquo;s problem. Focus on creating
value, and don&rsquo;t drift away from that value proposition.</p>
<h2 id="writing-code">Writing Code</h2>
<p>Be reluctant to write any new code. It must be your last option.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t start by thinking what code you need to write, but with how you&rsquo;ll know
that you&rsquo;ve finished. Try to make it explicit in an automated test.</p>
<p>Whenever you&rsquo;re about to write a print or debug statement, think on what needs
to happen, and convert it into an automated test.</p>
<p>Start small and increase in complexity and other dimensions as needed by
testing.</p>
<p>Always write your code as if comments doesn&rsquo;t exist. Strive for the simplest and
most self-documenting way you can come up with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing good, meaningful comments is hard. It&rsquo;s as much an art as writing the
code itself; maybe even more so. — Jeff Atwood</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rewrite code that is too hard to understand without comments.</p>
<p>Learn to read code, it&rsquo;s always the most up-to-date documentation.</p>
<p>When you have a problem in your dependencies, download the code and study it.
Follow the trail of what you need to understand.</p>
<p>Always stay on top of every little detail of your software. Constantly polish
and improve every aspect of it, no matter how trivial.</p>
<p>Speed is a highly appreciated feature; make your software fast.</p>
<p>Constantly test failure scenarios, otherwise your mitigation systems won&rsquo;t work
when you need them the most.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The best way to avoid failure is to fail constantly. — Jeff Atwood</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="development-process">Development Process</h2>
<p>Accept that we usually overestimate how much we can get done.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your email, phone, chats, or browsing impulses interrupt you from your
task at hand.</p>
<p>Prefer speed of iteration over quality of iteration. By having faster
iterations, you build momentum, engage your users, and make them feel part of
what you&rsquo;re building.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait until your software is perfect to ship it. You don&rsquo;t know what
“perfect” looks like until you ship it. Launch soon so you know what matters to
your users, and then improve your software best on the feedback.</p>
<p>How fast you improve upon feedback is far more important than any single
release.</p>
<h2 id="your-users">Your Users</h2>
<p>Consider your anonymous users as much as your registered users. Remember that
your registered users were anonymous at some point.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget the details. Your software is only a collection of tiny little
details.</p>
<p>Start designing the UI. Your users will only care about the UI, it&rsquo;s one of the
most important details.</p>
<p>Prototype the UI with anything you want except development tools.</p>
<p>Pagination works when there are a few pages. When you have thousands of pages,
you need to have search and filters, not pagination.</p>
<p>User experience is important. Study about it and work towards user friendly and
usable software.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ultimate unit test is whether or not users want to use your
application. — Jeff Atwood</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be close to your users. Talk to them, get feedback from them, learn from them,
and share their pains.</p>
<p>When receiving feedback, prefer watching what they do rather than listening what
they have to say. Confirm the feedback by analyzing the behavior of other users.</p>
<p>About 10% of your feedback will be very good. Be honest and respectful when
asked about something you&rsquo;re not planning on doing.</p>
<p>Think how to measure user behavior in a meaningful way that it&rsquo;s both
unobtrusive and useful for you to improve your software.</p>
<p>Work on bugs that bothers your users. Extremely rare bugs that nobody ever
encounters are not worth fixing.</p>
<p>Leverage gamification to increase engagement and reinforce learning about your
software.</p>
<h2 id="teams">Teams</h2>
<p>Never leave aside the personal aspect of work. Processes, people issues, and the
day-to-day is what will make your project successful or fail.</p>
<p>Always first presume that you&rsquo;re the one who&rsquo;s wrong.</p>
<p>Ensure that you&rsquo;re certain of your observations before sharing it to the team.</p>
<p>Work hard and focus on your actions and results; it&rsquo;s the best way to earn
credibility.</p>
<p>Care for your team.</p>
<p>Try to avoid meetings. If you can&rsquo;t, be sure the scope of the meeting is clear
and narrow, and that it has the necessary people and nobody else.</p>
<p>Make sure the scope of your meeting is to make things happen as a direct result
of the decisions made in the meeting.</p>
<p>Ask questions to engage the team and diffuse conflicts.</p>
<p>Working remotely works when your team likes to code as much as you do and gets
things done.</p>
<p>Agree on a unique channel to post announcements, weekly reports, and meeting
summaries. Every message on this channel has to be useful and meaningful,
otherwise it will harm more than help.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still important to interact with people. Never work more than one week
without video chatting with your team.</p>
<p>Protect your environment from interruptions. Deep work requires focused mental
concentration.</p>
