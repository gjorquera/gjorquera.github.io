    <p>Time management is not about managing time. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you have the
perfect tools or if you were able to cram up every waking minute of your day
with tasks.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing too many thing you&rsquo;ll end up exhausted without enjoying life.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re doing the wrong things you&rsquo;ll end up where you never wanted to be.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not doing anything you&rsquo;ll end up hating that “freedom” and reacting to
whatever happens around you.</p>
<p>Accomplishment comes with the right mindset. Decide what your future should look
like. Decide to do the right things. Decide to stop being always busy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can&rsquo;t just count activities, we have to weigh them, also. — Mike Burns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stop trying to manage time and start managing yourself.</p>
<p>Planning is very helpful even if things don&rsquo;t always go as planned. Don&rsquo;t try to
follow plans to the letter. Always leave extra space when making plans. Adjust
them when new information arises and keep moving.</p>
<p>Adapt to situations you have no control over. Practice your influence in
situations where you have some control. Choose when you have total control.
Learn to know the difference.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s too much of everything, except time. Simplify your life by removing
those unimportant things. A declutered mind can have peace and clearer
priorities. Choose well so you can live the life you want.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Everyone leaves something undone. The key is to be intentional about which
things we leave undone. — Mike Burns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Think and decide what is right for you. Who you want to become. What you want to
accomplish. What relationships you want to strengthen. Only after you have a
clear direction, you&rsquo;ll be able to focus on doing the right tasks.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let the opinion of others deviate your direction. Learn to decide for
yourself.</p>
<p>Spend more time working than organizing your work. Compulsive organization is
another form of procrastination.</p>
<p>Reduce the amount of time you waste. We all need to rest, but there may be some
excess you can reduce. Excessive television. Excessive internet. Excessive
reading.</p>
<p>Reduce the amount of time you spend on other people&rsquo;s priorities.</p>
<p>Consider your commitments and responsibilities. If it&rsquo;s important, you have to
do it.</p>
<p>Focus and work on your priorities. These are usually important but not urgent
things. Use your reclaimed time and enjoy the gratification of working towards
the life you want.</p>
<p>If you still want to do too many things, maybe it&rsquo;s time to let go of some.
Focus on the most important.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget, you can&rsquo;t be what you need to be for others if you aren&rsquo;t
focusing on your priorities. — Mike Burns</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We live in a complex world. Find a tool to help you remember tasks,
responsibilities, and information. Your brain alone won&rsquo;t be enough.</p>
<p>Figure out your priorities.</p>
<p>Every week review what you did last week and plan the next. Look for places of
improvement. Choose to work on the tasks that&rsquo;ll have the biggest impact on your
priorities.</p>
<p>Every day review what you did yesterday. Move what&rsquo;s undone and decide on the
most important tasks you should finish today.</p>
<p>Revisit your goals and priorities periodically. It&rsquo;s important to always work
with the most updated assumptions.</p>
