    <blockquote>
<p>In a fight, there is a fundamental difference between boxers and everyone
else. The guys who have trained are different. If you hit them, they don&rsquo;t
flinch. — Julien Smith</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this age, getting the information is not the problem. The flinch is your real
problem. And more information won&rsquo;t help you.</p>
<p>What is the flinch?</p>
<p>Anything that supports the status quo. The initial rejection whenever you want
to do something. Whenever you want to try something different.</p>
<p>Evolutionary speaking, the flinch is an instinct to protect you from the
unexpected. To protect your eyes and neck.</p>
<p>You were born with some fears to keep you safe: falling, abandonment, loud
noises, etc.</p>
<p>But, you are safe! You don&rsquo;t need to flinch anymore. Stop seeing everything as a
threat.</p>
<p>Mistakes are not final. Pains and scars are both temporary and part of the path.
Stop defending yourself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your privileged-world problems become the bear, and you treat them that way. —
Julien Smith</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Test your own limits. Learning from another person will only make you learn
other people&rsquo;s limitations.</p>
<p>Be proud of your scars because they are part of your path.</p>
<p>Step into a cold shower. The discomfort will only last a second.</p>
<p>Get lost. You will be able to get back home.</p>
<p>Hold a mug in your hand and then drop it. Being able to let go is more important
than anything you own.</p>
<p>Do the opposite of your habits.</p>
<p>Speak to the next stranger you come across.</p>
<p>Read things that are too difficult for you to understand.</p>
<p>Challenge yourself to do things that hurt, on purpose, only to show yourself
that you can.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not able to do any of the things above, just look at your failure.
Don&rsquo;t hide from it. Realize that all it takes is a single moment of strength.
Every time you are able to do it, you get stronger.</p>
<p>The goal isn&rsquo;t to get used to the pain. It&rsquo;s to understand that you can do
things despite the pain.</p>
<p>Overcoming the flinch will provide you with an ever growing set of experiences
that you can call upon.</p>
<p>You need to decide what to fight for and, if it&rsquo;s worth it, don&rsquo;t even let the
flinch to appear.</p>
<p>Judging if the flinch will help you or not is not the point. You can only
evaluate things from experience.</p>
