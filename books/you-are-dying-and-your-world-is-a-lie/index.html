  <main class="content">
    <p>Cave men were in danger. They could die from a cut that got infected, or a
twisted ankle that slowed them. From bad water or food gone scarce. You, on the
other hand, are not in danger anymore.</p>
<p>Your fears about your job, your finances, or your social status are not real.
Those things will not kill you. Life will go on.</p>
<p>Imagine you are diagnosed with cancer and given six months to live. That will
kill you., not your current fears.</p>
<p>Realise that it&rsquo;s your body that needs to fear something, the one promoting your
discomforts as pains, because it no longer has anything to actually fear.</p>
<p>You no longer need to be strong, since machines that do your hard work were
invented.</p>
<p>You no longer need to be fast, since bicycles and cars exists.</p>
<p>You no longer need to search for food, since there are now cheap, calorie dense,
superfoods.</p>
<p>Be aware of the security that the society has given us. Remember that there is
no good without bad. We are wired to experience pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>You are not as weak as you think. Face your boundaries head on to realise that
you can handle a lot more than you think.</p>
<p>Expand your joy by expanding your capacity to cope with discomfort and failure.
This capacity doesn&rsquo;t expand linearly, it expands in circles.</p>
<p>At your boundaries is where you find the fun and the real.</p>
<p>Own the new levels of discomfort you&rsquo;re able to reach. They are yours to claim.</p>
<p>Be aware of the time passing by. You&rsquo;re given a death sentence.</p>
<p>Realise that your past years are gone. They&rsquo;re never coming back. Never.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about petty details.</p>
<p>Face your boundaries head on, experience the real, and make use of your time
left. Don&rsquo;t worry if it hurts, that&rsquo;s where the fun is. This is where you live.
Don&rsquo;t be stupid.</p>
