    <p>Being awake breaks your body and sleep is the way to fix it and make it
stronger.</p>
<p>You <strong>need</strong> sleep to have the body and health you want. You can&rsquo;t be the best
version of yourself if you&rsquo;re tired.</p>
<p>See sleep as an incredible indulgence, as something you&rsquo;re really looking
forward to.</p>
<h2 id="general-advice">General Advice</h2>
<p>Avoid using sunglasses, they inhibit the natural exposure to light you need.</p>
<p>Learn to use coffee. Coffee has a 6 hours half-life. Go without coffee for days
(it can be cleaned out of your system in 3 days) and then use coffee if you
really need a boost.</p>
<p>Eat green leafy veggies, seeds like pumpkin and sesame, and super-foods like
spirulina and Brazil nuts for higher sources of magnesium.</p>
<p>Always have one 8-ounce glass of water with every alcoholic drink that you
consume.</p>
<p>Make sure the temperature of your bedroom stays close to 68 degrees Fahrenheit
at night. Try to stay a bit on the cool side.</p>
<p>Use non-restricting and hypoallergenic cloth to sleep.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t work in your bedroom. Block out lights from outside. Remove all inside
lights from your bedroom. Put an English Ivy in your bedroom.</p>
<p>Use supplements only after you&rsquo;ve done all other natural things. Don&rsquo;t start
with supplements.</p>
<p>Book yourself a massage periodically.</p>
<h2 id="daily-habits">Daily Habits</h2>
<p>Wake up always at the same time.</p>
<p>Get out of bed early. People are not designed for the night. We don&rsquo;t have good
sight, good smell, nor good hearing. We die at night.</p>
<p>Use coffee in the morning to boost your cortisol levels and begin the day.</p>
<p>Get more exposure to sunlight in the morning (06:00 to 08:30) and during the
day.</p>
<p>Do some exercise during the first part of the day.</p>
<p>Have a big breakfast. For example, vegetable omelet, sliced avocado topped with
kelp granules, and some omega-3 supplements.</p>
<p>Do a full workout in the mornings or in the afternoons. Do a couple of days of
strength training and a couple of days of some activity you enjoy.</p>
<p>Avoid coffee after 2pm.</p>
<p>Prefer strong caffeinated teas instead of coffee in the afternoon: Earl Grey or
English Breakfast.</p>
<p>Get less light exposure during the night.</p>
<p>Your last alcoholic drink should be 3 hours before bed time.</p>
<p>Have a warm bath 2 hours before bed time.</p>
<p>Your last meal should be 90 minutes before bed time.</p>
<p>Turn off all screens 90 minutes before bed time. Avoid the internet, it&rsquo;s a
constant release of dopamine. Read a book. Talk to your spouse.</p>
<p>If you really need to eat something closer to bed time, have a high fat and low
carb snack to ensure your blood sugar stays stable.</p>
<p>Chamomile tea, a cup of kava kava, or valerian (the strongest herb), are good
natural herbs to help you fall asleep and stay asleep during the night.</p>
<p>Practice meditation before going to bed. Don&rsquo;t meditate on your bed.</p>
<p>Schedule your sleep time to include the hours between 10pm and 2am.</p>
<p>Calculate your wake up time. Sleep cycles lasts around 90 minutes. Calculate
between 4 and 6 sleep cycles.</p>
<p>Go to bed within 30 minutes at the same time each night.</p>
<p>Right after getting to bed, use topical magnesium at night everywhere that you
are sore, in the center of your chest, and around your neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>Learn to relax your body, calm your mind, and fall asleep. Remember, for the
most part, you&rsquo;re no longer in real danger. Don&rsquo;t let your mind believe
otherwise.</p>
