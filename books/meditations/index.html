  <main class="content">
    <p>Realize that character needs training and discipline.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t waste time on nonsense, don&rsquo;t give the small things more time than they
deserve.</p>
<p>Accept that the world is maintained by change. Nothing can exist without change;
you can&rsquo;t even eat without you changing your food.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t live your life as you have endless years ahead of you. While you&rsquo;re alive,
be and do good. Think that you&rsquo;re dead; now enjoy what&rsquo;s left of your life and
live it properly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and
think. — Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contribute to discussions by answering the question, adding more examples, or
debating the issue itself. Don&rsquo;t focus on grammatical mistakes, pronunciation,
or phrasing.</p>
<p>Read and study attentively; don&rsquo;t be satisfied with understanding only the big
picture.</p>
<p>Praise without bombast and display expertise without pretension.</p>
<p>Focus on what&rsquo;s up to you, not on being passively controlled by things or
situations that aren&rsquo;t up to you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not &ldquo;some way to sleep with her&rdquo; — but a way to stop wanting to. Not &ldquo;some way
to get rid of him&rdquo; — but a way to stop trying. Not &ldquo;some way to save my child&rdquo;
— but a way to lose your fear. — Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do what needs to be done not what will give you the most credit.</p>
<p>Work on your tasks with diligence, energy, and patience; without fear or
expectations.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let your perception of external things stop you. If there&rsquo;s a problem with
your own character, work towards doing the right thing. If there&rsquo;s an
insuperable obstacle, depart from it as if you&rsquo;d done it, embracing it.</p>
<p>Concentrate on what&rsquo;s in front of you with precise and genuine seriousness. Stop
letting yourself be distracted and pulled in every direction.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you do everything as if it were the last thing you were doing in your life,
and stop being aimless, stop letting your emotions override what your mind
tells you, stop being hypocritical, self-centered, irritable. — Marcus
Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;re up to the task, do it. If you&rsquo;re not, hand it to someone who is. Don&rsquo;t
be ashamed to ask for help. Do the right thing; the rest doesn&rsquo;t matter.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t get out of bed to go to work in the morning, remind yourself that
you didn&rsquo;t born to be &ldquo;nice&rdquo; in bed, but to do and experience things.</p>
<p>Love yourself but also love your nature and what it demands of you.</p>
<p>Always be willing to hear unwelcome truths and take responsibility and blame. Be
straightforward; no strain, no stress.</p>
<p>Seek tranquility by doing less better, by doing what&rsquo;s essential. Eliminate
unnecessary assumptions so you can eliminate the unnecessary actions that
follow.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry about what other people think, it&rsquo;s distracting you from doing
anything useful, from strengthening your own mind. Other people&rsquo;s thoughts are
independent of yours; they&rsquo;re out of your control.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but
care more about their opinion than our own. — Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If someone blames you, despises you, or hates you, it&rsquo;s their problem. Yours is
to do what&rsquo;s right and say what&rsquo;s true. Always be ready to show them their
mistake in an honest and upright way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If it&rsquo;s not right, don&rsquo;t do it. If it&rsquo;s not true, don&rsquo;t say it. — Marcus
Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you think someone harmed you, but the community wasn&rsquo;t harmed, then neither
did you. You only perceived the action as harmful.</p>
<p>If someone did harm you, the best revenge is not to be like that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose not to be harmed — and you won&rsquo;t feel harmed. Don&rsquo;t feel harmed — and
you haven&rsquo;t been. — Marcus Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For every action, think how it affects you and if you can change your mind about
it.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be irritated by other people. If they can&rsquo;t figure out what&rsquo;s wrong and
you can, make them realize about it. If he listens then you solved the problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If smoke makes me cough, I can leave. What&rsquo;s so hard about that? — Marcus
Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Realize that getting angry at other people is the same as trying to forbid
someone to do what they think it&rsquo;s best for them. If you&rsquo;re angry because
they&rsquo;re not doing something good, then show them, prove it to them.</p>
<p>Respect and train your ability to control your thoughts. Practice honesty,
endurance, austerity, resignation, abstinence, patience, sincerity, moderation,
seriousness, high-mindedness.</p>
<p>Realize that it&rsquo;s very common to perceive things as better or worse than they
are in reality. Roasted meat is burned animal muscle. Exquisite wine is
fermented grape juice.</p>
<p>Be aware and try to consciously stay on the path instead of being kept on it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop allowing your mind to be a slave, to be jerked about by selfish impulses,
to kick against fate and the present, and to mistrust the future. — Marcus
Aurelius</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every day remind yourself that you&rsquo;ll deal with meddling, ungrateful, arrogant,
dishonest, jealous, and surly people. Also remind yourself that this is because
they can&rsquo;t tell good from evil.</p>
<p>When you bump into a shameless person, remember that it&rsquo;s impossible to have a
world without shamelessness. He&rsquo;s one of them.</p>
<p>When you say that someone is &ldquo;untrustworthy&rdquo; or &ldquo;ungrateful&rdquo; realize that it&rsquo;s
you who did wrong by assuming that someone like that person deserved your trust
or attention.</p>
<p>Be like the rock that the waves keep crushing over, unmoved while the fury of
the sea falls still around it. It&rsquo;s not unfortunate that something happened, but
fortunate that it happened and you were unharmed by it.</p>
<p>Enjoy material comforts if they&rsquo;re there, but don&rsquo;t miss them if they aren&rsquo;t
there. Treat the things you don&rsquo;t have as nonexistent. Look at what you have and
think how much you&rsquo;d want them if you didn&rsquo;t have them.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t stop attaching yourself emotionally and treasuring things, you&rsquo;ll
never be free.</p>
<p>Stop trying to be admired by posterity and start admiring your contemporaries,
the people you share your life with.</p>
<p>Reflect on the fact that you only have one life. You can&rsquo;t lose your past or
future as they&rsquo;re not yours. The ones that live long lives or the ones that live
short lives lose the same thing: their present.</p>
<p>Accept that death is nothing but the dissolution of the elements from which each
living thing is composed. It&rsquo;s a natural thing, and nothing natural is evil.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop whatever you&rsquo;re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death
because I won&rsquo;t be able to do this anymore? — Marcus Aurelius</p>
