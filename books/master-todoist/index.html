  </aside>
  
  <main class="content">
    <p>You can&rsquo;t store all your ideas, tasks, and appointments in your mind. Life is
just too complicated.</p>
<p>Develop the habit of capturing everything that comes to your mind in one place
and the habit of periodically reviewing them. Only by doing so, you&rsquo;ll be able
let go and fully concentrate on the task at hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It has been said that once upon a time, the word <em>priority</em> was used in the
singular form, which meant you could only have one priority at a time.
Unfortunately, in our modern frenetic world, everyone seems to have dozens of
<em>priorities</em> — S. J. Scott</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>There are six different types of tasks that you can store in Todoist: habit
building, appointments, ideas, actions, projects, and processes.</p>
<h3 id="habit-building">Habit Building</h3>
<p>Use Todoist&rsquo;s recurrent tasks and reminders feature to get you to do something at
a specific time or location.</p>
<p>To keep consistency, create small, realistic habit building tasks, that you can
complete daily even if you feel a lack of interest.</p>
<p>Aim to do much more than the task requires to be completed. If you don&rsquo;t have a
lot of time or energy, force yourself to do the bare minimum to keep momentum.</p>
<h3 id="appointments">Appointments</h3>
<p>Tasks that requires you to be at a certain place and time.</p>
<p>Make sure your appointment tasks are added with time in Todoist, so you can have
something very similar to your daily calendar at the top of the Todoist&rsquo;s Today
view.</p>
<h3 id="ideas">Ideas</h3>
<p>Tasks that are usually not actionable and very big in scope. Anything that pops
into your head that you want to remember and evaluate at some time in the
future.</p>
<p>Whenever an idea pops into your head, regardless of when and where, add it to
Todoist&rsquo;s Inbox and then let go.</p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>Tasks that are well defined and reduced in scope that don&rsquo;t require too much
advanced planning.</p>
<p>Should be completed in a few hours or less.</p>
<h3 id="projects">Projects</h3>
<p>Tasks that require more than one concrete action to complete. Use Todoist&rsquo;s
projects to group tasks together. A project can include dates and milestones.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to specify every action required to complete the project. Focus on a
handful of actionable tasks that are the next steps. That&rsquo;s more than enough to
start working.</p>
<p>Keep adding actions, after you&rsquo;ve started working on the project and after you
have more information, by asking yourself &ldquo;what is the next step?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Projects can be done in a day or they can take weeks.</p>
<h3 id="processes">Processes</h3>
<p>Projects that you know beforehand the actions needed to be completed.</p>
<p>After completing a couple of the same type of projects, you can convert it into
a checklist or template that can be reused in the future.</p>
<p>For example: planning and packing for a weekend trip, publishing a blog post,
writing and publishing book notes.</p>
<h2 id="doing-the-work">Doing the Work</h2>
<h3 id="daily-ritual">Daily Ritual</h3>
<p>Every morning pick the three Most Important Tasks that will have the biggest
impact on your career: two related to a project with an immediate deadline and
one related to a long-term goal.</p>
<p>Use red flag, orange flag, and yellow flag priorities to the first, second, and
third Most Important Task.</p>
<p>A task can be a priority only if it&rsquo;s time sensitive or crucial to your
long-term success. The only way to complete your priorities is not by marking
them as priorities but by not doing things that are actually not priorities.</p>
<p>Finishing all the tasks in your day is not as important as finishing your Most
Important Tasks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve completed all your MITs and scheduled appointments, then it&rsquo;s
perfectly okay to not achieve Todoist Zero. — S. J. Scott</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Always ask yourself &ldquo;what is the next step?&rdquo; when looking at your projects.</p>
<p>Explicitly block out time in your calendar for high priority tasks and for tasks
that require a lot of concentration. Plan for these tasks to take a lot of time
to avoid feeling anxious because you&rsquo;re not making progress as fast as you&rsquo;d
like.</p>
<h3 id="batching">Batching</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t jump from project to project and from type of task to type of task.
Context switching is very expensive.</p>
<p>Use labels to batch related tasks. Then you can filter your tasks by label and
do all of them in batch.</p>
<p>For example: tasks you can finish in under 5 minutes, or tasks you need to do
over the phone, or tasks you&rsquo;re waiting on that needs pinging someone.</p>
<h3 id="eisenhower-matrix">Eisenhower Matrix</h3>
<p>Use filters to implement Eisenhower&rsquo;s priority matrix based on urgency and
importance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Q1: Urgent and important — <code>(overdue | today) &amp; (p1 | p2 | p3)</code>.</li>
<li>Q2: Important but not urgent — <code>(no date) &amp; (p1 | p2 | p3)</code>.</li>
<li>Q3: Urgent but not important — <code>(overdue, toda)</code>.</li>
<li>Q4: Not important and not urgent — <code>(no date)</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="weekly-ritual">Weekly Ritual</h3>
<p>Every week review your goals and projects and decide the what you want to focus
on this week. Don&rsquo;t fill your week to every minute, leave space for unexpected
commitments.</p>
<p>Answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are my personal obligations?</li>
<li>What are my priority projects?</li>
<li>How much time do I have?</li>
<li>What are the next actions on my Todoist projects?</li>
<li>Is there anything on the Someday/Maybe project that I&rsquo;d like to focus on this
week?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="your-life-as-projects">Your Life as Projects</h3>
<p>Create a parent project for every aspect of your life: career, finance, health,
leisure, relationships, service, spirituality.</p>
<p>Limit the number of projects you want to pursue in the short term to only five.</p>
<p>Create an extra &ldquo;someday/maybe&rdquo; project for all those ideas that you&rsquo;d like to
pursue soon but not right now. This is where you think big.</p>
<h3 id="your-goal-in-life">Your Goal in Life</h3>
<p>Don&rsquo;t complete tasks for the sake of completing them.</p>
<p>Use Todoist to help you keep laser focused into the projects that will most
impact your life and achieve your life-long goals.</p>
<p>One action at a time, one project at a time.</p>
