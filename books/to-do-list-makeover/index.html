    <p>The key to make this system work is to accept that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowing how to identify what&rsquo;s important is crucial. These are usually tasks
with impending deadlines or tasks that has great impact to your goals.</li>
<li>There are different types of tasks.</li>
<li>Small tasks with clear completion criteria are easier to complete and builds
momentum.</li>
<li>Creating tasks thinking on how to achieve the end result are better.</li>
<li>Tasks are not life or death activities.</li>
<li>Flexibility is as important as consistency. It&rsquo;s important to leave time for
unexpected situations.</li>
<li>Task management is the first step. Actually doing the work is more important
than having a perfect system.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<p>Tasks should be added into different lists according to their nature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idea Capture List: A central place where you can write every idea you come up
with, so you don&rsquo;t forget anything.</li>
<li>Project Lists: Whenever something requires two or more tasks, it belongs to a
project.</li>
<li>Weekly Task List: Tasks you decide to do on a given day and/or time of the
current week.</li>
<li>Most Important Tasks: List of three tasks that you think generates the biggest
impact on your life.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="idea-capture-list">Idea Capture List</h2>
<p>Your primary way to capture all your ideas, allowing you to let go of them and
keep focus on the task at hand.</p>
<p>Whenever you come up with an idea, write it to the Idea Capture List.</p>
<p>Develop the habit of writing everything that you think of, even you find it
dumb.</p>
<p>Ideas can be vague, unspecific, or unachievable. You&rsquo;ll process ideas every
week.</p>
<h2 id="project-lists">Project Lists</h2>
<p>Once a week look at all your ideas from the Idea Capture List and decide if you
want to work on some this week.</p>
<p>Convert each idea into a Project List. Be precise in specifying the end result
of the project.</p>
<p>Brainstorm the idea and break it into small actionable tasks.</p>
<p>Only include tasks with a near deadline or critical for the success of the
project. Prioritize them.</p>
<p>To create good tasks, start with the desired result and work backwards. Decide
what steps you need to complete to achieve that result.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t create tasks just for the sake of completing them.</p>
<p>Characteristics of good tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Has a clear reason to exists. It should relate to a long term goal.</li>
<li>Includes a specific action.</li>
<li>Has a measurable outcome.</li>
<li>Has a defined beginning and ending.</li>
<li>Can be completed in a single time block.</li>
<li>Includes a rough estimate (you&rsquo;ll improve over time if you&rsquo;re consistent).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="weekly-task-list">Weekly Task List</h2>
<p>Each week create a new Weekly Task List.</p>
<p>Divide your day into activities for the morning and activities for the
afternoon. If you work on weekends, consider those days.</p>
<p>For each block (or hour) schedule:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise, errands, time with family, house chores, and cooking.</li>
<li>Routine tasks to reinforce habits.</li>
<li>Appointments, meetings and personal obligations.</li>
<li>Important tasks from your project lists. Don&rsquo;t fill your day with tasks, add
only the most important ones.</li>
<li>Leave space for unplanned activities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Putting all your activities into one list helps you have a clear idea of how you
are going to spend your time.</p>
<p>Schedule more difficult tasks for when you are most productive.</p>
<p>It should be a guideline to keep you on track for completing goals and getting
you closer to where you want to be.</p>
<p>This is the list you look at before committing to something new this week.</p>
<h2 id="most-important-tasks-mits">Most Important Tasks (MITs)</h2>
<p>A list of three specific actions that will have the biggest benefit for you.</p>
<p>This list works best if you pick two tasks from a project and one task from a
habit you want to create.</p>
<p>Try to make these items the first thing you do each day. That way you can reduce
the risk of not finishing due to the unpredictability of life.</p>
<p>Choose today&rsquo;s MITs from the Weekly Task List.</p>
<p>Once you finish your MITs of the day, you can keep going over the Weekly Task
List or Project Lists.</p>
<p>Write your MITs at the end of the previous day or first thing in the morning.</p>
<h2 id="doing-the-work">Doing the Work</h2>
<p>Knowing which tasks to do is important, but actually doing it is even more
important.</p>
<p>Rate each task with an energy level. Low energy tasks might be taking a vitamin.
High energy tasks might be exercising or writing an article for an hour.</p>
<p>Make sure your Project Lists include low energy tasks.</p>
<p>As your motivation, willpower and energy fluctuates through the day, pick tasks
that match your current levels.</p>
<p>The “Pomodoro Technique” helps to manage energy levels via time blocking.</p>
<p>When having difficulties with a task, think on why are you afraid of it.
Possible reasons are uncertainty, probability of failing, difficulty, or
frustration.</p>
<p>Some strategies to overcome fears are removing distractions, writing down what&rsquo;s
stopping you, creating a plan for each obstacle, or thinking on the rewards.</p>
<p>The most simple strategy is to define a task so easy that you can just do it.
Finishing it will build momentum and start motivating you.</p>
<h2 id="the-weekly-ritual">The Weekly Ritual</h2>
<p>Schedule one hour on Sunday afternoons to reflect upon your current week and
plan the next one.</p>
<p>Congratulate yourself for your accomplished tasks of the current week.</p>
<p>Ask yourself these three questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are my personal obligations? Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to reduce the output
if you have too many personal obligations.</li>
<li>What are my priority projects? Focusing on a handful of projects each week
helps to finish them.</li>
<li>How much time do I have? Be true to yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then follow these steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process the Idea Capture List. If it takes two minutes, do it now. If it&rsquo;s an
idea you want to tackle this week, write a Project List for it.</li>
<li>Create the Weekly Task List for the current week.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-daily-ritual">The Daily Ritual</h2>
<p>At the beginning of every day, perform this ritual:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check your appointments and meetings.</li>
<li>Pick from your weekly list the three MITs for today, and start working.</li>
<li>Commit to finishing your MITs. Focus on completing small easy tasks to build
up motivation.</li>
<li>Once you finish your MITs, keep working from your Weekly Task List or from
your Project Lists.</li>
<li>Make hard decisions. If you a task is more than three days old, either do it
immediately, schedule a date, or delete it.</li>
<li>Write down what&rsquo;s going through your head if you feel stuck.</li>
<li>Remember to be flexible, tasks are not life-or-death. Practice continuous
improvement.</li>
</ul>
