    <p>Build the daily habit of morning preparation and evening reflection. Surrender
and trust, through sleep, that tomorrow you can start all over again.</p>
<p>Three disciplines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perception: How we see and filter the world around us.</li>
<li>Action: Decisions and what we do and to what end.</li>
<li>Will: How we deal with things we cannot change and figure out our place in the
world.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Virtue—made up as it is of justice, honesty, discipline, and courage—is the
only thing worth striving for. — Ryan Holiday and Stephen Hanselman</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="perception">Perception</h2>
<p>Read and meditate on the wisdom of great minds to learn how to live.</p>
<p>You only have one thing to manage: your choices (your will, your mind).</p>
<p>Differentiate what you can from what you can&rsquo;t change. Time spent worrying about
things you can&rsquo;t change is time not spent on things you can change.</p>
<p>Even if you don&rsquo;t control a situation, you still control what you think about
that situation.</p>
<p>Seek tranquility by filtering the outside world with proper judgement, not by
eliminating outside influences.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to stay on top of everything happening in the world.</p>
<p>Practice the ability of having no opinion about something, as it has never
occurred. Let it become irrelevant to you.</p>
<p>Be in control of your passions instead of by your passions. Anger is not
impressive. Strength is the ability to maintain a hold of yourself.</p>
<p>Shrug off hostile attacks. Don&rsquo;t get upset by things outside of your reasoned
choice.</p>
<p>Protect your mind more than your body. The world can control your body but your
mind is yours. Maintain control over it as if it were your most prized
possession.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait for the weekend to have peace and quiet. You can find retreat at any
time by looking inward.</p>
<p>Connect the temptations with its actual effect. Understand that indulgence might
be worse than resisting. Make self-control become the real pleasure.</p>
<p>What you desire makes you vulnerable. Evaluate your goals and ask yourself if
you&rsquo;re in control of them or if they&rsquo;re in control of you.</p>
<p>Stop seeing yourself as more than you are. Stop valuing yourself less than your
true worth. Cultivate the ability to accurately and honestly judge yourself.</p>
<p>Take an inventory of your obligations. Are you as free as you think? How many of
these obligations are self-imposed?</p>
<p>Always ask yourself: Do I need this? What&rsquo;s its worth? What&rsquo;s its cost?
Everything has a cost, even what we get for free. At the very least there&rsquo;s a
storage cost, both in our garages and in our minds.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk about your past. Nobody cares about it. Listen and connect with
people, don&rsquo;t perform for them.</p>
<p>Before you speak, pause and think. Make sure you&rsquo;re not reacting emotionally,
selfishly, ignorantly, or prematurely. Speak only when you&rsquo;re confident that
your words are worthy of being heard.</p>
<p>Every day and each situation is an exercise. If you fail, tell yourself that
you&rsquo;re learning.</p>
<h2 id="action">Action</h2>
<p>Go live your life. Study is important but its through action and choices that
you know what you learned.</p>
<p>To have a good day, do good things. How you handle today is how you&rsquo;ll handle
every day.</p>
<p>Get up at the right time, make your bed, resist shortcuts, invest in yourself,
do your work.</p>
<p>Find pleasure in doing the right thing rather than seeking the results. You
don&rsquo;t have to do the right thing. You get to. You want to.</p>
<p>Be good, be wise. Whatever other people&rsquo;s job happen to be, do yours.</p>
<p>Prioritize quality over quantity. Practice. Don&rsquo;t justify it, it&rsquo;s what you do
to be great.</p>
<p>Train with humility. Picking up things quickly makes you skip the basics.</p>
<p>Learn how to say no. It may hurt some feelings but the more you say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to
things that doesn&rsquo;t matter, the more you say &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to the things that do.</p>
<p>Control your addictions. Have the freedom to abstain. Practice abstaining
yourself only to know that you can.</p>
<p>Make a plan to direct your actions. Having a plan is no guarantee that it will
work but not having one is a guarantee that it won&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to have every answer, every contingency plan. Be confident that
you&rsquo;ll be able to adapt. Cultivate creativity, independence, self-confidence,
ingenuity, and the ability to problem solve.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s overwhelming to look at the big picture. Focus exclusively on the
present to avoid intimidating thoughts.</p>
<p>Make character your loudest statement. Actions determine if you&rsquo;ll get where you
chose.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t talk about something you know. Show it through your actions instead.</p>
<p>Always say less than necessary. Let the other person figure it out.</p>
<p>Nobody said that you were born with all the tools you need. If you need help,
ask.</p>
<p>When you get stressed, overwhelmed, or have a tough problem, decision, or need
to be creative, take a walk.</p>
<p>Hold yourself to a higher standard but forgive yourself when you fail. Failure
is a part of live. Learning from failure is optional.</p>
<p>Being a leader means stepping up and helping. Thankless service comes with the
job.</p>
<p>Remember that people are depending on you to do great work together.</p>
<h2 id="will">Will</h2>
<p>Experiencing and surviving misfortune helps you understand your own capacity and
inner strength.</p>
<p>Always prepare yourself to what life might throw at you. Be ready. Don&rsquo;t stop
until you&rsquo;ve handled it.</p>
<p>Frustration comes from us thinking that a certain event was unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>Spend one day a month experiencing the effects of poverty, hunger, complete
isolation, etc. After the initial shock, it would start to feel normal and not
so scary.</p>
<p>Get used to surviving on less so that if you&rsquo;re ever forced to, it wouldn&rsquo;t be
so bad.</p>
<p>Ask for fortitude and strength instead of divine intervention.</p>
<p>If there&rsquo;s a chance to influence or change other people&rsquo;s opinion, then take it.
If not, then accept it.</p>
<p>Put aside jealousy and possessiveness. Teach yourself to cheer for other people.</p>
<p>Always ask yourself: Is this the kind of person I would like to be?</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse being better at stuff with being a better person. Always remember
to have time for people.</p>
<p>Be a good person and pursue the occupation you love. Say no to distractions, to
destructive emotions, to outside pressure.</p>
<p>Whenever something happens that you wish hadn&rsquo;t, changing your opinion is easier
than changing the past event.</p>
<p>Not only accept what happens, but enjoy it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to believe in God. You only have to stop believing that you&rsquo;re
at the center of the universe.</p>
<p>Focus on acquiring inner power, control over yourself, not outward power.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t complain. Don&rsquo;t explain. It never achieves anything.</p>
<p>Accept, don&rsquo;t judge, other people&rsquo;s faults.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t try to grab to moments of happiness. You don&rsquo;t know how long they will
last.</p>
<p>Cultivate ignorance. Turn your mind away from the things that makes you angry.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re a Stoic. Whatever happens, you&rsquo;re going to be fine.</p>
<p>Use every day to make yourself satisfied with what you&rsquo;ve been given.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to quote others. It&rsquo;s harder to express your own thoughts. Put
something down for the ages.</p>
<p>The purpose of all the reading and studying is to help us live a good life. At
some point, put the books aside and take action!</p>
