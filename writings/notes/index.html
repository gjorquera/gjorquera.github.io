    <p>I bet you can recommend me several books that have changed your life in some
way. But, can you honestly say that you have internalized the teachings of every
one of them? Maybe you can&rsquo;t, but can you at least summarize them? If not, can
you even tell me the key topics?</p>
<p>Are you satisfied with what you remember from those essential and life changing
books? If you&rsquo;re not, then this might help you.</p>
<p>After reading <a href="https://gaston.life/books/make-it-stick/">Make it Stick</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/key-lessons-from-books/heres-what-i-learned-from-reading-5-000-pages-in-8-weeks-and-getting-paid-for-it-too-cfbb9df173f4">Here&rsquo;s What I Learned from
Reading 5,000 Pages in 8 Weeks</a>, and <a href="https://sivers.org/2do">Compressing Books into
Directives</a>, I realized that I&rsquo;ve been approaching the whole process
of learning from books all wrong.</p>
<p><em><strong>Credits</strong>: None of this information is original. All the credit goes to the
cited authors. Also, thanks to Marco Montero, who told me about Make it Stick
that started my quest for better learning.</em></p>
<h2 id="before-reading-the-book">Before Reading the Book</h2>
<p>Check the book’s background. The Wikipedia or <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/">goodreads</a> entry is
good enough. It’ll help you form a general idea of what to expect. It’ll also
help you start making associations with your previous knowledge.</p>
<p>Write the outline or table of contents in a sheet of paper. Having it close at
hand helps recall previous topics while reading the book.</p>
<p>Skim over the book to pick up the key topics and write them next to your written
version of the table of contents. Having them within reach helps building a
mental map of the important new topics.</p>
<h2 id="while-reading-the-book">While Reading the Book</h2>
<p>Highlight anything that makes you say “Interesting. I want to remember that.”</p>
<p>For the most part it will be counterintuitive information or things that may
surprise you. It can also be something written in a particularly clear way that
you want to remember.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need to highlight what you already know. Avoid striving for a self
contained summary. These are notes for you to remember and internalize new
information. They are not meant to replace reading the book.</p>
<h2 id="after-reading-the-book">After Reading the Book</h2>
<p>Open a blank file and copy all the notes to it and then edit them. This step is
extremely important.</p>
<p>Try to change the wording converting statements into advice. Re-organize things
considering the key topics. Finally, put them in a way that will help you
remember the information while reviewing it in the future.</p>
<p>Make them available in your phone and look at them periodically; every time you
have 5 or 10 minutes to spare. Try to memorize and really internalize them until
it seems like second nature.</p>
<h2 id="now-its-your-time">Now It&rsquo;s Your Time</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to change your current learning process, but keep in mind
that learning is not easy. Make it a priority and give it the attention and
dedication it deserves.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve published all my <a href="https://gaston.life/books/">book notes</a>. Look at them to get an idea of what
they look like.</p>
